## Add mjanalytics to your website

Simply include the analytics script in your website, and it will start gathering data. 

```html
<script defer src='https://analytics.marcusj.org/analytics.js'></script>
```

If you would like the number of views to be displayed, you can do so like this:

```html
<!-- views will be displayed on element with ID 'duplanalytics' -->
<div id="duplanalytics"></div>
<!-- adding the 'show' param will enable this feature -->
<script defer show src='https://analytics.marcusj.org/analytics.js'></script>
```
